# Project 2 - *WORDLE PT2*

Submitted by: **Julie Amon**

**WORDLE PT2** is an app that ... is a continuation of wordle part 1. But we add some new features like 
adding new themes, change the size of the word were looking for, and the number of guesses. In addition we added
a feature called Alien Wordle settings too

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

While building the app, I had a hard time with the first exercise because I wasn't sure I didn't fully understand why we would need the ?. The link that was given to us in the hints though was very helpful and allowed me to understand how to use the ? and what they allow us to do in XCode. I also hard a bit of a hard time figuring out were to put Bool for the alien part of the code. But, once I reflected on the previous code, I saw were I had to implement the boolean.
